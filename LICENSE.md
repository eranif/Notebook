### Licence

wxWidgets is currently licenced under the "wxWindows Library Licence" pending approval of the "wxWidgets Library Licence" which will be identical apart from the name.

The wxWindows Library Licence is essentially the L-GPL (Library General Public Licence), with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that satisfies those who wish to produce GPL'ed software using wxWidgets, and also those producing proprietary software.

Participants in the discussion that led to this decision include the folk from AbiSource, Robert Roebling, Julian Smart, Markus Fleck, Karsten Ballueder, and some advice from Richard Stallman. Richard has confirmed that the new licence is compatible with GPL'ed applications. However, there are no significant restrictions on proprietary applications.

The wxWindows Library Licence has been approved by the Open Source Initiative.

In August 2005, an ambiguity in Clause 2 was removed (replaced "the user's" with "your") and the version bumped to 3.1.
Preamble

The licencing of the wxWidgets library is intended to protect the wxWidgets library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment it represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the original wxWidgets licences, you as a user are not obliged to distribute wxWidgets source code with your products, if you distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the rights to use or distribute wxWidgets library source code in the way intended.

The wxWindows Library License establishes the copyright for the code and related material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWidgets library contains files under two different licences:

    Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public License, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own terms.

    Most core wxWidgets manuals are made available under the "wxWindows Free Documentation License", which allows you to distribute modified versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original manuals.
